## Technical Architecture

### Encryption Flow
```
User Data ‚Üí PBKDF2 Key Derivation ‚Üí AES-256-GCM Encryption ‚Üí Secure Storage
```

### Data Storage
- **Desktop**: SQLite database with encrypted fields
- **Web**: Browser localStorage with encrypted data
- **Backup**: Encrypted JSON export format

### Key Management
- Master password never stored in plain text
- Keys derived on-demand from master password
- Automatic key rotation capabilities
- Secure key deletion on logout
